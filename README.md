#### Description:
  The IdeaBox application let the user create a card with a title and a body. The card also has a favorite button, a delete button and search box.

#### Functionality:
##### The user can:
- Create cards with custom title and body.
- View cards after reload.
- Favorite a specific card, the favorite icon would start from a white star and turned into a red star.
- Delete a specific card, the card would be deleted in local storage and no longer displayed.
- Local storage was implemented in this project to allow users to create new ideas and to view their history of ideas even after the web app is refreshed.
